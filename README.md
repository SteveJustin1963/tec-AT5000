## The Victorian police
"Conversations with Colin Mitchell of “Talking Electronics” magazine fame. This interview took place on the 23rd of Feb 2011 in Melbourne. In the interview, Colin talks about his beginnings with electronics, how he got the idea for the magazine and the books that followed. Colin reveals how he was the first to put a printed circuit board on the front of the magazine and in a famous case, on the front of his series of books entitled “FM Bugs”. The Victorian police bought kits from Colin’s store, including one which could listen in to telephone conversations. This caused a lot of problems for Colin, which landed him a seat in the courts. The Australian WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ACT 1905 was "repealed" by Act No. 136 of 1983 thanks to Colin's case. Colin off course was shocked and dismayed but continued on selling other kits including the famous TEC-1 computer - A Z80 based project with detailed explanations on how to build and program it."

"I'll leave others to discuss the specifics of the demise of TE. 
From my point of view it stopped because the 1980s ended. Most of the electronics magazines consolidated and then folded by the 1990s. There was a new wave of computer and gaming magazines by then but the electronics magazines which were created to service a market of radio & hifi enthusiasts and TV service repairmen began to fade as a demographic. Electronics Australia, Electronics Today "International", two giants that always dwarfed TE (and resented it greatly) folded. TE's readership tended to split into hardware types and software types and moved into their own circles. "Electronics" was no longer the great binding topic, there were by then too many specialisations. Australian manufacturing (like the British) fizzled out as well as things became more uniform and standardised around IBM's PC (hell even Commodore and Atari vanished).
Then the web happened and also the open source software revolution which cut out the ability to sell information. From my point of view 1980s was a transitionary period from when information was still scarce and hard to obtain. By the mid-1990s, the great information firehose of the internet was everwhere and people are no longer starved of information but drowning in it.
Thankfully however, the internet also saved this stuff from complete obscurity and has given it some renewed exposure. Things that I thought had been lost forever, were scattered or locked away in private collections are now being shared and new things are being built. In the case of the TEC-1, I doubt we would be talking much about it today if it wasn't for the work of Ben Grimmett who got a new TEC-1 board out there and being made. Also thanks to the preservation work of Alan Laughton who collected together so much endangered software from that period. 
And this group of course which has the combination of nostalgic early readers of TE who remember when it was great combined with the next generation of creators and makers who bring a completely new angle to all of this."
