We plan to develop a telephone autodialer that draws inspiration from the AT-5000 auto dialer featured in the Simpsons. Our approach will involve a combination of software and hardware components. The software will be sourced from various providers, including the TE14's "Dialer" software. Additionally, we will incorporate hardware elements from the TE-Dial-Alarm-2. To achieve this, we will do a ASM (assembly language) version then a MINT code version.

For the design of our autodialer, we will refer to the AT5000 Power Dialer as described on the Wikipedia page. We will carefully select the desired features from the AT5000 and determine the best approach to combine them. The selected features include:

- Indicators: We will utilize the tec1 LEDs to indicate functions such as play, record, dial, redial, and power.
- Buttons: The tec1 keypad will incorporate buttons for play, record, power, keypad, 100, manual, auto, and tape-red.
- Display: The tec1 LEDs will serve as the display for our autodialer.
- Tape: The tec1 keypad will feature a left/right knob for tape control.
- Speaker: We will utilize the tec1 speaker for audio output.
- Back: Our autodialer will have an RJ45 connector at the back.
- Circuit: The circuitry will include components such as a microphone, opto coupler, diode bridge, and DTMF decoder.
- Voice: We will incorporate the LX20LYA voice audio module, providing a 20-second voice capability.

By combining these software and hardware elements, we aim to create a functional and inspired autodialer reminiscent of the AT-5000 from the Simpsons.
