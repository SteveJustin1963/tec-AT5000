We will use a combination of software and hardware to create a telephone autodialler that is inspired by the AT-5000 auto dialer from the Simpsons. The software will come from various sources, including; 
- issue TE14's software "Dialer," 
- and we will use hardware from the TE-Dial-Alarm-2. 
- also incorporate some ASM (assembly language) and MINT code in the process of hacking these components together.
